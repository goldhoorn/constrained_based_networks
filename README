= What is this =

This software library is a new approach for handling component networks.
In difference to other solutions the behavior of a system is fully specified
by known states generated by the component pool itself. Moreover all components 
for a (or even multiple) systems are represented by a model-definition. 
By reducing the system behavior to such set, a complete pre-calculation
and evaluation of the system behavior and all components for each point in time
could be generated before the whole system starts.

This leads into the capability to have a model-based software development process
which includes model-checking and verification.

= State of this Software =
The Software is under development it is part of the thesis from Matthias Goldhoorn
in Computer Science / Robotics. As usual it is not (yet) documented and the code
is under heavy development which means it is neither fully functional nor cleaned up.
